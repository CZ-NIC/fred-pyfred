2007-02-13 Jan Kryl (version 1.4.0)

	* TechCheck module is now able to do regular technical checks of
	all registered nssets.

	* TechCheck has administration interface which is used for searching
	in archive of executed checks.

	* Numerous improvements in check scripts used by techcheck module.

	* Email templates now share the same footer. The footer is not
	duplicated in all templates as it was.

	* pyfred server has its own start/stop/status script called pyfredctl.

	* New attribute 'type' of file is kept about files managed by
	filemanager. Not confuse this new attr 'type' with MIME type,
	which is another attribute of file.

	* Mailer signs all sent emails. Signing is accomplished
	by M2Crypto python library, which is wrapper around openssl library.
	Both theese libraries must be installed when running mailer module.

	* FileManager was modified to transfer files chunk by chunk in
	sequence. The size of chunk is selectable by client. In princip
	for upload or download of a file is created independent CORBA
	object, which handles transfer of data.

	* Documentation is more complete.

2006-11-24 Jan Kryl (version 1.3.0)

	* Over-branding of pyccReg to new name pyfred was done successfully.
	Old name still remains at some places, but those places cannot be
	changed without affecting other parts of registry software.

	* The configuration file is no more shared with central register
	written in C++. Pyfred has now its own configuration file name
	pyfred.conf containing sections for individual modules.

	* Database connection management is done now by pyfred core and
	not by modules, as it was till now.

	* Modules are now able to register jobs (functions) which should
	be run in regular periods. Pyfred core now supports this neat
	feature.

	* New module filemanager was created. Filemanager is capable of
	storing files and loading files. As storage backend is used
	filesystem, some meta information about files is kept in database.

	* New module mailer, used for sending email notifications, was
	created. It depends on clearsilver templating library.

	* Rewrite of genzone module (inspired by new mailer module).
	For each zone transfer is created separate corba object now.

	* The concept of safe-interval was implemented in genzone.
	Additionaly all domains, which should not be generated in zonefile
	first time on that day, are excluded after concrete hour, common
	for all domains.

	* History of inclusion or exclusion of domain in zone is now kept
	in database together with reason of not being included. The status
	is generated by set of complicated SQL statements (credits Jara).

	* Serious bug was fixed in genzone client. For ipv6 addresses
	was not generated record AAAA but same record as for ipv4 addresses.

	* Coding of CORBA strings was explicitly set to UTF-8 in server and
	all clients. Different encodings of two ORB endpoints resulted in
	missinterpretation of national characteres.

	* Configuration file pyfred_modules.conf was removed, since there
	is no reason for it to exist, when we don't share configuration file
	with C++ central register. Modules which should be loaded are now
	specified in pyfred.conf.

	* New modul techcheck for execution of technical checks on nssets
	was created. Scripts realizing individual tests are in subdirectory
	techchecks. In order to be able to run the test scripts, DNS python
	library, fpdns perl script and whois client must be installed
	in the system.

2006-10-20 Jan Kryl (version 1.2.1)

	* The output of genzone client, when running in test mode, was
	modified in order be fulfill expectations of Nagios monitoring tool.

	* pyccReg listens on static port since now, because of better
	ability to do firewalling.

2006-09-27 Jan Kryl (version 1.2.0)

	* This ChangeLog was started in order to keep better overview
	of changes. The ChangeLog serves for whole pyccReg project (server
	and clients, etc.).

	* All files and directories in repository where reorganized in
	better hierarchy. Makefile was completely rewritten.

	* README files where added at places where they were most needed.

	* Database change - the column for ip address of primary nameserver
	in table zone_soa was removed. Primary nameserver data are now
	maintained together with other nameservers in table zone_ns.
