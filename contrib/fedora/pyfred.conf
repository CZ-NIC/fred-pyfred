# The detailed description of configuration can be found in README. Consider

# Note that this is the default configuration which might work (or not)
# depending on many circumstances
# (i.e. location of postgresql server, nameservice, ...)

###

[General]
# List of modules to load (separated by spaces)
modules=genzone mailer filemanager techcheck
# pidfile is the file where the server records its process id
#pidfile=/var/run/pyfred.pid
# Host where PYFRED listens for CORBA calls
# (empty value binds PYFRED to all available IP addresses)
#host=
# Port where PYFRED listens for CORBA calls
port=2225

#### Database settings
# Database host or empty value for Unix socket
dbhost=localhost
# Database port
dbport=5432
# Database name
dbname=fred
# Database user name
dbuser=fred
# Database password (if required)
dbpassword=

#### CORBA nameservice settings
# Nameservice host
nshost=localhost
# Nameservice port
nsport=2809
# Nameservice context (check with the ``namectl`` command)
nscontext=fred

#### Logging settings
# Log handler selection:
# * syslog  (see also logfacility option)
# * file    (see also logfilename option)
# * console (can be used only if server is not daemonized after start)
loghandler=file
# Log level
# * debug
# * info
# * notice
# * warning
# * error
# * critical
# * alert
# * emerg
loglevel=debug
# Specify syslog facility (if handler is syslog)
#logfacility=local1
# Specify log file (if handler is a file)
logfilename=/var/log/fred-pyfred.log

###
### Zone-generating module configuration
###
[Genzone]
# DS record digest algorithm sha1|sha256
#   default: sha1
dsrecord_algo = sha1

#### CORBA objects lifetime settings
# Timeout (seconds) after which objects are considered idle
#   default: 3600
#idletreshold=3600
# Interval (seconds) between checks for idle objects
#   default: 60
#checkperiod=60


###
### Mailing module configuration
###
[Mailer]
# In the test mode, all emails are sent to tester's email address instead
# of the appropriate recipient.
#   default: off
testmode=on
# Tester's email address (only for the test mode)
# If left empty, emails are discarded and archived in the database.
#   default: empty
tester=
# Path to sendmail binary (or a compatible program)
#   default: /usr/sbin/sendmail
sendmail=/usr/sbin/sendmail
# The mailer module is dependent on file managing services. Set this
# to the name under which this object is accessible in the CORBA nameservice.
# Format: [contextName.]ObjectName
#   default: fred.FileManager
filemanager_object=FileManager
# Turn on/off cryptographic signatures
#   default: off
signing=off
# Signing is done by running external command (openssl). This option defines
# how many rounds (for simplicity 1 round ~ 1 s) should we wait for command output
# before subprocess is killed.
#   default: 8
signing_cmd_retry_rounds=100
# Path to the binary that will be used to sign emails
#   default: /usr/bin/openssl
#openssl=/usr/bin/openssl
# Path to certificate and key (for email signatures)
#? certfile_nic_cz=/etc/fred/cert/podpora.pem
#? keyfile_nic_cz=/etc/fred/cert/podpora.key
#? certfile_mojeid_cz=/etc/fred/cert/podpora_mojeid.pem
#? keyfile_mojeid_cz=/etc/fred/cert/podpora_mojeid.key
# Interval (seconds) between sending email bulks
sendperiod=30
# Limit for the number of emails sent in one bulk
sendlimit=100
# If enabled, a text/x-vcard attachment is added to each email.
# Do NOT turn this off! (Outlook Express cannot open multipart emails
# if they contain only a single part.) When vcard is turned on, we are sure
# that this never happens.
vcard=on
# Enable manual confirmation of emails submission. Emails will not be
# sent until manually confirmed (which is acomplished by changing status in
# mail archive table) if this is turned on.
manconfirm=off
# Maximum number of attempts to send email in case of a failure
maxattempts=3
# Interval (seconds) between mailbox checks for undelivered messages (0=disable)
#   default: 0
undeliveredperiod=0
# Username for IMAP account
#IMAPuser=
# Password for IMAP account
#IMAPpass=
# Host and optional port where IMAP daemon runs
#IMAPserver=
# Use secure connection
#IMAPssl=yes

#### CORBA objects lifetime settings
# Timeout (seconds) after which objects are considered idle
#idletreshold=3600
# Interval (seconds) between checks for idle objects
#checkperiod=60

###
### File-managing module configuration
###
[FileManager]
# Absolute path of the directory to store managed files
rootdir=/var/lib/pyfred/filemanager/

#### CORBA objects lifetime settings
# Timeout (seconds) after which objects are considered idle
#idletreshold=3600
# Interval (seconds) between checks for idle objects
#checkperiod=60

###
### Technical-checks-executing module configuration
###
[TechCheck]
# Test mode disables test execution (level 0 is assumed for all tested nssets)
#testmode=off
# Allow background perodic checks (in addition to checks requested by clients)
#periodic_checks=on
# Directory that contains scripts for technical tests
scriptdir=/usr/libexec/pyfred
# Service life of techcheck poll message (days)
msgLifetime=7
# Treshold (days) after which a tech.check is considered out-dated
oldperiod=30
# Interval (seconds) between runs of queues inspection procedure. If the queue of asynchronously
# scheduled check is emtpy, a new regular check is enqueued (depends on periodic_checks
# and missround settings)
queueperiod=5
# If there was no candidate for regular check, this number of rounds (queue inspection
# procedure runs), SQL query of looking for another candidate will not be issued (load optimization)
missrounds=10
# Path to the drill utility (part of ldns-utils) used for a dnssec related
# technical test (key chase)
#   default: /usr/bin/drill
drill=/usr/bin/drill
# Trusted key to be used by the drill utility for a signature chase run
# (NOTE: actually if not set, dnssec signature chase test cannot be run)
trusted_key=
# The tech.check module is dependent on mailing services. Set this
# to the name under which this object is accessible in the CORBA nameservice.
# Format: [contextName.]ObjectName
mailer_object=Mailer
# This is a type of email which is used when sending emails through mailer.
#mailtype=techcheck

#### CORBA objects lifetime settings
# Timeout (seconds) after which objects are considered idle
#idletreshold=3600
# Interval (seconds) between checks for idle objects
#checkperiod=60
