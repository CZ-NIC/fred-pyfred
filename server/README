1. Introduction

pyccreg server is part of central registry written in python. Server has
modular architecture. There is one file which serves as a framework for
modules and other files which implement modules. Every module implements
one CORBA object which is registered in CORBA nameservice upon startup
of server.

Additional info about zone generator module can be found in README.genzone.


2. Description of files

In alphabetical order:
    ccreg_util.py - utility functions shared accross the modules
    genzone.py    - module for zone generation
    pyccReg_modules.conf - tells which modules should be loaded upon
                    server startup
    pyccReg.py    - the main server (starts modules)
    pyccReg.sh    - start/stop script for pyccreg (not usable)
    whois.py      - module implementing whois server


3. Configuration

The server looks for ccReg.conf in current, /etc, /usr/etc directories in
this order. There are provided defaults for all configuration directives
which are used if config file is not found or if a directive is not set
in config file. Other configuration file is pyccReg_modules.conf looked
up in the same directories as ccReg.conf. This file configures modules
which should be loaded upon server startup.


4. Run

The simplest way, which might not work in all cases depending on
environment and configuration is:

          $ python pyccReg.py
