This whois script implements a client from CORBA's point of view, because
it connects to CORBA whois server, but it is a server from whois client's
view, because it listens on port 43 and serves whois requests. We will refer
to this script as client in this README file.

The client is written as simply as possible. It is NOT PRODUCTION READY and
is used only for testing purposes or in emergency cases. It has no
configuration file, everything is hardwired in source code. It is very
slow, because only one request is served at one time.

Before you run whois client, type "make" (or "make idl") to statically
generate IDL stubs.
